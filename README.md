# Russian-Facebook-Propaganda-Efficacy
Our motivating question going into the analysis of the Russian Propaganda involved the efficacy of advertisements by the Russian “Troll” Farm that targeted the American public through social media platforms. Originally intended to observe how effective the ads were as a political weapon leading up to the 2016 General Elections, the major factor considered in this study was to provide supporting evidence in the change of voting patterns due to the Russian propaganda. In order to analyze a change in voting patterns, a comparison was drawn from the election cycles during both 2016 and 2012 using the latter as the control group for the study. The underlying research question has since evolved in predicting the overall effectiveness of Russian ads given a combination of predictors like location, ad theme, and demographic information about the populations targeted among different states. The current analysis uses Bayesian methods applying a two-way fixed-effects linear regression model to measure the efficacy of ads with the response variable as a Click-through Rate among the designated state and year groups.
